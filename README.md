# Term Theory (MVP)
Exploring a type-free, arrows-only foundation (Term Theory MVP),

with a minimal (possibly dependent) structure:

```cpp
struct Term {
    Term* domain;    // (possibly dependent source)
    Term* codomain;  // (possibly dependent target)
};
```


## **Ideas for extensions:**

- `id(Term*)` — identity arrow

- `compose(Term*, Term*)` — composition

- `recurse(Term*)` — self-dependent term

- Visualize as infinite unfolding tree:

          ```
          Term
           ├─ domain : Term
          	 └─ domain : Term
          		 └─ …
           └─ codomain : Term
                └─ codomain : Term
                     └─ ...
          ```

- Term Theory can be extended along the lines of classical type theories, giving rise to the following hierarchy of arrows-only analogues:

| Type Theory                  | Term-Only Cousin             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Simple Type Theory           | Simple Term Theory           |
| Dependent Type Theory        | Dependent Term Theory        |
| Homotopy Type Theory         | Homotopy Term Theory         |
| Cubical Type Theory          | Cubical Term Theory          |
| Linear Type Theory           | Linear Term Theory           |
| Modal / Temporal Type Theory | Modal / Temporal Term Theory |


*This project explores whether a type-free, arrows-only foundation can be a seed for a minimal logic/programming language.*
